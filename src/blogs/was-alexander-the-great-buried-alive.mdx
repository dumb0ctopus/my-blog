What do you know about Alexander the Great? That Aristotle tutored him until he turned 16? That he ascended to the throne at age 20, succeeding his father, Philip II? Or that he declared himself the King of Asia around 26? Perhaps you’re aware that he passed away at 32. But did you ever consider the possibility that he might have been buried alive or that his fate might have been sealed during his embalming?

According to Plutarch, the ancient Greek historian, Alexander fell ill with a fever after a 24-hour drinking spree and experienced a sudden pain in his back ‘as though smitten with a spear.’ Soon after, he became paralysed and lost his ability to speak.

Ultimately, at the age of 32, Alexander was declared deceased. The fact that his body did not decompose for six days after his death left the ancient Greeks astounded. His followers interpreted this as clear evidence of his divine status. However, was that truly the case?

According to a theory, the lack of decomposition could be attributed to Alexander not being dead yet. Dr. Katherine from the University of Otago in New Zealand believes Alexander suffered from Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS).

Historically, this rare autoimmune disorder can cause abdominal pain and paralysis, which aligns with Plutarch’s account of Alexander’s demise. She suggests Alexander contracted this rare disorder due to a Campylobacter pylori infection, the most common cause of GBS worldwide.

According to her hypothesis, Alexander was declared dead a full six days before he truly passed away. This could potentially explain Plutarch’s description of Alexander’s body remaining ‘pure and fresh for days.’

If this scenario holds true, it’s conceivable that Alexander might have been an unwitting witness to his embalming – a process that likely involved disembowelling in preparation for his burial.
