Flame was a guy who loved women and sex but wanted no kids. Here was what he once told his friend: “I don’t need those little pieces of shit in my life.”

He also hated using contraceptives during sex; he claimed it reduced the pleasure he was supposed to feel. However, not using contraceptives made him very conscious during sex since he had to always pull out at the right time if he wanted to prevent any chance of being a father.

His pull-out game wasn’t that great, and even though he had successfully gotten women to abort their pregnancies for him, he wondered how long he could keep that up.

He was sitting at his desk at work with a computer in front of him, absent-minded and oblivious to what was happening around him when an idea popped into his head.

“Pregnant women!” Flame said loudly.

His co-worker, sitting beside him, with a look of surprise, said to Flame, “Pregnant women?”

Realising what he had said out loud, Flame replied with a look of innocence, “Nothing, I just had a great idea.”

Here was Flame’s thought process: having sex with pregnant women would mean he would not have to use contraceptives and thus avoid being a father altogether. He had just cracked the puzzle!

But did he?

Ten months after Flame put his idea into practice, one of the women he had slept with, who was three weeks pregnant at the time, told him that she had given birth to his son.

Flame, thinking it was a joke, laughed it off. He thought it was funny until the woman explained what had happened.

Pregnancy scans had shown that she had two foetuses in her womb.

The simple explanation was that the foetuses were a twin, right?

After delivery, her husband wanted to be sure the kids were his, so a DNA test was conducted. Both kids were not his; only one was. The test was repeated, but the result was the same. The doctor decided the result didn’t make sense except…

The doctor explained a phenomenon to them: “Normally, a pregnant woman’s ovaries temporarily stop releasing eggs. But in a rare phenomenon called superfetation, another egg is released, fertilises with sperm, and attaches to the uterine wall, resulting in two babies.”

Here is a quick summary: Since one of the babies was not the husband’s, it must belong to someone else…

The only other person the woman had sex with during that period was Flame, which was why she came to him. A DNA test was performed, and it showed that Flame was the father.

The woman’s husband told Flame he would sue him when he came up with a reason.

The woman’s husband eventually sued Flame for “endangering his offspring.” But that, of course, was the least of Flame’s problems.

And there we have it. Flame was going to become a dad. He would also have to battle the husband of the mother of his child in court!

He was in deep shit, and it definitely was not how he thought his plan would unravel.

Events such as a pregnant woman conceiving another child were rare, but they did happen, and Flame found himself on the very wrong end of this.
