In times uncertain did I entreat

How much time do I have left?

How well does my life compare to those who have slept?

Those who in time past crept and leapt

To save themselves from the hand they were dealt

Their fingers copper and lead often felt

To make from them a substance they could smelt

All their lives they did toil and sweat

Till at last they embraced that fearful rest

Oh that they could tell of that which they met

Maybe they couldn't for they found nought
