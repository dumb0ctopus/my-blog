<h1>PRELUDE</h1>
He looked at the glass before him as though he needed to be convinced to drink its
transparent liquid.

He wondered if the material that held the liquid was a product of glass or plastic. With the little he knew, polycarbonate plastics, identical to glass, were cheaper and even served better in place of glass for some purposes.

He knew there were unusual ways to quickly determine which, including dropping the material to see if it would break or using something sharp to make a mark. More straightforward methods would be to place it close to a light source to determine if it were reflective enough-something that could hardly be performed in the current room he was in because of the dull lighting. The simplest would be to tap the material and see if it produces a clear ringing or a soft
thudding sound. He had no interest in performing any of those tests.

For someone who was obsessed with the notion of getting things done the right way, he was not bothered by the fact that what he was holding might not be glass, but was commonly referred to as as such, since the material, by scientists, had been described as “plastic glass” and so, he decided that whatever the material was, “glass” was as good a name as any for it.

With the glass in his left hand, he brought it closer to his mouth. He was getting accustomed to the odour he could perceive, and he smiled at the thought that he would have pronounced the drink rubbing alcohol if his sense of smell were the only thing he could go by. He had no idea why he was so confident that what he was taking wasn’t harmful to
him-outside the harm generally caused by alcoholic drinks.

In stark contrast to what was in his glass, rubbing alcohol was something he had much experience with. It was something he dreaded as a kid whenever he got himself injured. He used to think that adults took immense pleasure in kids’ pain with how they dressed their wounds regardless of the horror displayed on the faces of said kids. He discovered as he grew that he could not have been more wrong.

He almost emptied the glass in his hand with a single gulp while tightening his lips and occasionally holding both cheeks with the molars in his jaw. He exhaled through his nose after about two seconds; the gas exchange at that point through his nasal passages made him feel like a fire kindled inside his head.

“That which I drink is that which I once dreaded,” he said calmly, looking down at the almost empty glass before him.

“First time?” he heard someone say beside him. He realised he was not alone in the room for the first time that evening. He turned his head toward the voice and was impressed by what he saw.

The woman was dark-skinned; she had big brown eyes, thin lips, and loosely curled black hair. She wore a tight red
armless-sleeved velvet mini dress that showed her knees.

He looked around and again, for the first time that evening, realised where he was: a bar. Brown chairs, brown tables, and brown walls. The sitting positions followed some pattern, but not one that he could easily decipher. With the sky dark and about two other people in the room, he could tell it was extremely late!

He was wondering how he got there when she spoke to him again.

“Is this your first time here?”

“Yes," he replied.

“So, what were you drinking?” she said, pointing at his cup.
He had no answer to that. He could not remember placing an order or getting served by the bartender. It then made sense why he was sure a few moments earlier that he was taking an alcoholic drink instead of rubbing alcohol. He looked towards the bartender’s shelf, checking for bottles to see if he could remember something, but he could not.

“Let me see,” she said with a little laugh, gesturing for him to pass the glass on the table.

He held the glass in one hand, his chair in the other, moved closer to her, and handed her the glass as he sat down.

“Vodka,” she said a few seconds after drinking from the glass.

“You know a lot about drinks?” He asked.

“Yeah,” she said smiling. “Enough to know that the brand of vodka you’re taking is cheap as fuck.”

“Does that explain why it bears an uncanny resemblance to rubbing alcohol?” He asked.

“It sure does,” she replied.
“As a matter of fact, I’m taking the same drink,” she said, raising her glass toward him before drinking from it. “A

crappy night deserves a crappy drink!”

He perceived the fragrance coming from her direction, and he loved the smell but could not tell what type of perfume
it was. He also saw something else.

“Bad night?” he asked, pointing to the reddish swollen part on her left temple.

She touched the spot unconsciously and looked like she was reliving an event.

“Boyfriend problems,” she replied.

“Can I?” He asked as he gestured with his right hand and indicated that he wanted to examine her face.

"Be my guest," She shrugged.
He moved closer and made it as though he would touch her face. When she did not attempt to resist, he placed his left hand on her chin and tilted her head to his left a little before he felt the swollen spot with his right hand.

“You do not deserve this,” he said after some seconds of examination.

She tilted her head back to face him, his hand still on her chin and their faces almost touching; she smiled and
said, "No one gets what they deserve."

He looked at her amusingly for some seconds before returning to his seat. She emptied the remaining liquid in her glass into her mouth and placed it back on the table with a force that might have broken it if it were made of actual glass.

She stood, pulled her dress down a little, and walked towards the door. She was almost there when she turned around and said, “Actually, I lied. No one gets what they deserve, not always.”

She took a few steps towards him.

“We just might get lucky tonight,” she said as she stretched her right hand towards him. “Come on.”

“You don’t even know my name,” he replied after he had studied her for a while and realised she was be taller than he first thought.

“We aren’t getting married,” she replied, smiling. “Come on, boy. It’s getting late….”

<h1>CHAPTER I</h1>

<div className="quote">
  - Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble. 
  - ~Job.
</div>

Slade took another look at his fingernail. He was focused on completing the task at hand. He took pride in himself for this reason: that every enjoyable endeavour he had ever undertaken for some time now had been perfect, or, at least, was close to being perfect. He didn't always like to think about the latter case of perfection, but he thought it practical to agree that nothing could be perfect.

He was wrong, of course. None of his works were ever close to being perfect. Also, “Nothing could be perfect?” Of course, a three-dimensional creature would think that way!

He had neither blade nor nail clipper, and yet, he wanted the trimming of his claws to be just as smooth as though e used one. He put his index finger back in his mouth and rubbed the rough edges aggressively against an incisor tooth on his lower jaw. He did that for some minutes and stopped when he was satisfied with the result he could now see.

Trimming the fingernails with the teeth in Sade's country was considered a bad habit. But Slade couldn't care less about that. He couldn't care less about people’s opinions, especially if his actions had no adverse effect on others. 
Little did he know that habitual nail biting could cause his teeth to wear away, leading to further problems.

The truth was that Slade cared a lot about what people thought about him. He was just really good at pretending that he didn’t.

He now thought of an article he had read some time ago. It was about how fingernails grow at about three millimetres per month. The report also said they grow faster than the toenails and that those on the dominant hand grow faster 
than those on the non-dominant hand.

He once tried to find out how accurate the statement from the article was; after five weeks of careful monitoring, he decided that either the report was wrong or that the naked eye could not measure the difference in the growth rate of the nails on either finger. He also decided that he couldn't care less about the growth rate of his fingernails.

This was in a bid to console himself. He always said it whenever things didn’t go how he expected.

It was a sunny day, 1:30 pm, and Slade didn’t like that there was little he could do to shield himself from the sun’s rays hitting him. A few hours earlier, he would have been able to console himself that he was receiving a natural vitamin from the sun; This is just punishment, he thought.

He had been on the road for an hour and twenty-five minutes. On average, it took only about two hours to reach his destination from his starting point, but he had yet to complete half the journey. The problem was traffic. It was a prevalent problem in his country due to persistent bad roads and a myopic insight into road design. Both issues could be attributed to the government of his country. They were short-sighted in almost everything they did.

The government of his country couldn't care less about this problem. They couldn't care less about any situation that didn't affect them.

His country and others like it were labelled as “Third World Countries” by more developed nations. This, in simple terms, meant that his country was shit!

The dictionaries in the time he lived in had termed the word "shit" as "vulgar" and "colloquial.” Vulgar was always bad, while colloquial was sometimes bad, depending on when it was used.

Shit sometimes meant faeces; you could derive many other meanings from this. Here is what Slade said to someone who made him angry a day before: "Do you know how worthless faeces is? Well, that's how worthless I think you are!"

Faeces were not worthless. People paid to buy them to make use of them in their crops. This would make those crops grow bigger and better than if they were not used. What I'm simply trying to say here is that FARMERS LOVED SHIT! The process of applying faeces to plants to improve them was called manuring.

The actual truth was that nothing was ever useless. In the 4th century BC, long before Slade existed, Empedocles, a Greek philosopher, made this statement: "For it is impossible for anything to come to be from what is not, and it cannot be brought about or heard of that what is, should be utterly destroyed." Let me put it the way the scientists of Slade's time put it: "Energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another."

Émilie du Châtelet first proposed this. She was a mathematician and a philosopher. So many people in Slade's world didn't know about Émilie du Châtelet. So many would have problems pronouncing her name.

Back to energy!

Some would argue that energy isn't the same as matter, but the relationship between both was described by a scientist named Albert Einstein with the equation:

<div className="poem">E = m c²</div>

The equation means energy and matter are interchangeable.

If the people in Slade's world had applied the above science or philosophy in their everyday lives-that, things described as “worthless” or “useless” could have become useful-they would have lived better lives, and their planet would still exist.

How did they go into extinction, you ask? That's a story I'd love to tell. But some other time.

Slade began to look forward to the next time his vehicle would move in the traffic jam he found himself in. He found it interesting that he wanted the car to move not so he could get to his destination early but to dry off the sweat running through his body with the rush of air coming into the vehicle through the windows. He also yearned to feel the cool that would follow.

He thought it sad that he had never boarded an air-conditioned public transport vehicle.

I suppose that mirrors the country’s state, he thought.

<h1>CHAPTER II</h1>

<div className="quote">
- The nature of the mind is to think
- ~René Descartes.
</div>

Slade was tired of sitting down. He had been sitting for about two hours and began to think of time estimates before he got to his destination. He also began to think of other reasons why vehicles were no longer moving asides from those of the substandard nature of the road. It could have been due to several reasons: an accident, some vehicle malfunction, the number of vehicles on the road at the time…

The character "…" is called an ellipsis. It helps get right to the point without delay or distraction. Many people in Slade's world wished they could quickly eliminate distractions in their daily lives by saying, "Dot, dot, dot." At that moment, Slade wished he or the vehicle he was in could fly, but if wishes were horses…

It is raining, not in Slade's world, but in mine. This could be a source of distraction. The rain is hitting the roof of the building, giving off a rumbling sound as though there is a tremor, but the building is not shaking. As it turns out, I also cannot say “Dot, dot, dot” to eliminate my problems, but I have other methods.

Slade could get out of the vehicle to stretch his body if he wanted. But he would not. He hated any attention. He was very good at being “invisible.” He thought it was his nature, but there was another reason: he was afraid people did not give a shit about him. It was some sort of mind game, and he played it this way: "I do not give a shit about you, so I do not give a shit that you do not give a shit about me!"

Not giving a shit, in this instance, means not caring. Many people in that world used the word a lot.

Slade thought about ridiculous things whenever he was sad or bored. The present predicament of his country made him sad all the time, and now, he was bored.

He began to think about flying cars. That shouldn’t be a surprise since such a vehicle would solve his present transportation predicament. Flying cars in Slade's time was still a "work in progress.” That meant that there were no flying cars at the time. They were still being developed.  

How hard would it be to create a flying car? He thought to himself. I just might be able to do something about it when I am rich...

He never became rich.

In Slade's world, there were things called "movies.” Many people were deceived by those movies’ contents, especially those termed "science fiction.” The truth was that there was nothing scientific about some of the ridiculous ideas that were portrayed in them. What the producers of such movies wanted was something that would excite the viewers. Sometimes, they added a bit of actual science, and sometimes...

Flying cars were ordinary in science fiction movies, making Slade wonder why they were unavailable. Isn't it just science? How hard could it be! We have planes! It should be a walk in the park!

A walk in the park means something easy to do. Creating flying cars was not one of those things.

Using flying cars in Slade's country might have been challenging, at least until the electrical wires hanging haphazardly all over the place were passed underground. That was something else the government could not give a shit about. Those hanging wires were dangerous and could cause harm if they fell, but…

To his credit, Slade then considered something that was unpopular in science fiction movies. The idea was that of making the body of every vehicle possess similar poles of a magnet. According to him, a reduction in vehicle collisions would reduce accidents considerably. In movies, accidents made things interesting and exciting, so you can imagine why such an idea was never exploited.

Slade would have made a good living as a science fiction movie director or writer. Such an idea could only be effective in movies and would probably intrigue many people. But in reality, it would be disastrous. Why? Vehicles would no longer need to hit themselves for accidents, but they would still occur.

I would like to give you the science behind that, but you will have to take my word for it.
Slowly, vehicles began to move, and Slade was tired. He thought about taking a quick nap. He hoped he would be closer to his destination when he woke up.

He was right this time, but not how he imagined it. Thirty metres forward would undoubtedly get him closer to his destination, and the vehicle moved way more than that. But by the time he woke up, he still had not gotten halfway through the journey!

<h1>CHAPTER III</h1>

<div className="quote">
- The cops are not your friends.
- ~Hunter Thompson.
</div>

Saying “Slade’s country” feels boring now, so I should name it.

You must understand that all earlier and future events have been made up by me, just like you sometimes make things up. Here is where we are different; it becomes real whenever I make something up. The same cannot be said about you, at least not here. Here, you can only observe.

I am going to name the country Nonce Republic. Nonce used to have many meanings, including “a stupid or worthless person.” But I have changed the word’s meaning since I can do whatever I want. It now refers to the third-world country where Slade lived; hence, Nonce Republic does not refer to a country governed by stupid and worthless people!

Slade saw a man in a black uniform and a black beret. He was with an old gun with signs of rust on it. Slade shook his head in dismay as his vehicle passed slowly by.

Slade remembered his parents telling him he had been in school since he was about 7 months old. He wondered why people wanted kids so much, only to dispose of them after a short while.

Schools were supposed to be places where kids were taken to become more intelligent and to learn more about how the world worked… But sometimes, they were brainwashed. Here is an example:

<div className="centered-image">
  <img src="/blogs/blackboard.png" alt="Description of image" />
</div>

Teachers wrote on blackboards using something called chalk. Chalks were made from limestone. Limestone was a type of rock called sedimentary rock.

Those poor kids believed the lie. Not the part about rocks, for that was true, but the part about the police being their friends and all… Slade also thought it accurate as a kid, but not anymore.

Slade remembered something that happened when he was thirteen years old. It was one-fifteen in the morning, and he was supposed to be asleep. Each person was supposed to be doing something specific at a particular time and age. It was as though their lives were being controlled just like they controlled robots! Those who refused to behave like robots were deemed recalcitrant.

Robots were intelligent mechanical beings designed to look like humans or other creatures and were usually made from metal. Humans built them to carry out tasks for them.

Humans were also designed, but they usually argued about who or what created them.

Anyway, humans were not robots-although, some humans thought they were in a simulation and that beings of higher dimensions controlled them-but, they did behave like one!

I will neither confirm nor deny my status as a god or as a being or a higher dimension. Neither will I confirm to what extent I have power to other the steps of my creation once I've made them!

Stars fascinated Slade. He was trying to see how many he could count before sleeping. He estimated about fifty-three the previous night and was about to begin when he noticed some movements in front of him. It was at the neighbour’s house next door. He could see the house clearly through his window.

He observed for about 30 seconds when he noticed that the people moving had masks on. Thieves! He thought. He had heard a lot about them. He rushed to his parent’s room to tell them about what he had seen. When his parents got to his room to look, the thieves were no longer outside, but they could hear some noise coming from their neighbour’s house.

Slade’s parents did what citizens were supposed to do at such a time: they called the police. Some other people would have tried to confront the thieves, but Slade’s parents were not that brave or stupid (depending on whom you asked).

The thieves were done in twenty minutes and were out of the house. The police did not arrive until after two hours! They claimed the roads were so bad they could not get there in time! They then proceeded to ask Slade’s neighbours to support them with any amount of money they had so they could buy fuel which they claimed their vehicle was about to run out of! They also asked for money to help investigate the crime thoroughly, more than they would normally do!

They never caught the thieves.

Slade heard his parents talk about how the police were cowards and greedy and were not ready to make sacrifices for the people they were supposed to protect. At that point, Slade began to realise he had been lied to in school.

Slade thought again about when he was a kid. He remembered that the police used to stop vehicles at checkpoints. A handshake between the police officers and the drivers mostly followed this. Slade used to think that that was the police being friendly. He found out later that what he thought he knew was far from the truth. He began to call those types of handshakes “moneyshakes.” That was the police collecting bribes from people they were supposed to arrest or caution.

The nature of policing in Nonce was so terrible that even people who had all the necessary documents and had nothing to fear from the police still paid money to them once they asked to avoid any form of trouble that might arise from displeasing them.

Slade was in a vehicle with his parents and brother one afternoon when he saw the police threaten to shoot a driver if he didn’t come out of his car. They pointed their guns at him to show that they meant business. Slade was afraid, and he was shivering. His brother noticed and said, “Get your shit together; we will be all right.”

Shit here meant “wit,” and wit meant senses. Proper thinking results in organisation. But it was pretty hard even for some adults to think appropriately when someone might be killed before them.

Slade’s mother had repeatedly told both Slade and his brother to stop using vulgar words. This time, she only looked back and gave him a nasty look.

The driver, being threatened by the police, later heeded their request. He was hit on the head with the bottom of a gun, and while being dragged away from his vehicle, he screamed: “I have every document I am supposed to have as a driver, and I have no money to pay you crooks!”

According to Slade’s dictionary, a crook is a person who steals, lies, cheats, or does other dishonest or illegal things; a criminal…

The dictionary definition of a crook applied perfectly to the police in Nonce.

Slade came to the same conclusion about the police.

<h1>CHAPTER IV</h1>

<div className="quote">
- So, it’s true when all is said and done,
grief is the price we pay for love.
- ~E.A. Bucchianeri.
</div>

Slade was not really in a hurry to get to his destination. It was a Saturday, and he was going to his university for a new session. He shared a room in the school hostel with a roommate.

He would have liked to be in school before four o'clock that afternoon so he could attend a programme he looked forward to, but he soon realised that he would never make it to the program. He was right in more ways than he imagined. The time was four-thirty in the afternoon. He was two hours and thirty minutes into a journey that should take a maximum of three hours, but he still was several kilometres away from his destination.

He reached for his bag and took out a book he had been reading for some time. The book was titled: ‘Great Ideas' Engendering Unfortunate Events. It was about people who thought they found brilliant solutions to their problems, but things didn't work out as well as they thought. Stone Clarke wrote the book.

The first story in the book was about a man named Totem. Totem was a truck driver who earned twenty thousand drachmas per month. Even though Totem had a wife and two kids, he didn't think he had anything to live for and got tired of his living predicament. He felt stuck whenever he went home after the day’s work and wondered how he ended up with the woman he called his wife. “Of all the women on this planet!” he sometimes said to himself. His monthly salary was barely enough to care for his wife and kids. They were living hand-to-mouth, and his wife’s disposition towards him did not make things easy for him.

Totem moved goods as usual from a manufacturing plant to retail centres. He thought about creative ways to improve his life-the only thing he ever thought about whenever he was on the job-when a particular idea struck him. He decided he finally found a way to be free of his wife, kids, and job and still live a pretty good life! He thought it was the best idea he had ever conceived.

About two minutes after he conceived the idea, Totem hit five vehicles on the highway with his truck, causing injuries to several people in those vehicles and death to one of them. He was imprisoned two weeks after the judge pronounced a ten-year sentence on him. He pleaded guilty to every charge that was levelled against him. His sentence could have been worse-he was disappointed he did get more-but because he had no previous criminal record, it was reduced.

Immediately after the sentence was passed on to Totem, he said to himself, “Mission accomplished”. He thought it was the best thing that had happened to him in his 40 years living career on planet Terra. He couldn't have been more wrong.

Life was good in prison. He ate good food twice daily, watched TV at a specified time, and even went to the gym for a limited time.

Slade then understood why someone would think going to prison would end their troubles. Slade began to consider the idea wasn't such a bad one except that its execution could have been better such that he didn’t put people’s lives in danger.

Listen, prisons in Nonce could be compared to a death sentence. They were terrible. This interested Slade in the type of prison he read about in the book. He had never heard of such prisons. Prisons like that had better living conditions than that which the average person in his country experienced! That was how bad Slade thought Nonce was.

It wasn’t that bad but they were getting there.

Two months into his prison sentence, Totem was having a warm bath. He wondered why he didn’t think of his great idea earlier. He was humming a song to himself when he felt the presence of someone in the shower with him. He turned to find a tall and lanky man standing right before him.

“What do you want?” Totem asked him.

The Man laughed.

“What do I want?” he replied, feigning surprise as though Totem should have an idea.

“Here is what I want; I want to kill you.”

Totem was not entirely certain he heard him right.

“What? What have I done?” Totem asked nervously.

“You were meant to die by my hands,” the man began to say. “Of all the prisons you could have been locked in, you ended up in one with the man whose mother you killed.”

Totem saw the man's face become deadly serious.

“I’ve been watching you for some time now, and I have to say, you seem to be enjoying yourself here. I’m tired of seeing you every day, knowing you killed my mum even though I never really liked her. You know, she was a pain in my ass, but still, she was my mother, and I think it was time you joined her.”

Totem, at that point, felt cold. There was no one else in the bathroom. He tried to scream to call the attention of the correctional officers, but he didn’t have time to do that. A quick slash at his throat, and he couldn’t speak anymore. He had no time to think before he died, and the last thing he heard was, “Say hello to her for me.”

If Totem did have time to think, he would have realised, just like Slade, that his idea wasn’t great, at all. The unexpected could happen even in “good prisons,” but Totem didn’t account for that.

Slade flipped the pages of his book to page twenty-nine, where he stopped the last time he read the book.

The story was about a twenty-three-year-old guy named Flame. Here was the solution to Flame’s problem in his own words: “All the fun and no stress.”

Now, Flame was a guy who loved women and sex but wanted no kids. He once told his friend, “I don't need that shit in my life.”

“Shit” here describes something unwanted regardless of how good it might be; in his case, it was a child.

He also hated using contraceptives during sex; he claimed it reduced the pleasure he was supposed to feel. But not using contraceptives would make him very conscious during sex since he had to avoid ejaculating into the woman if he wanted to prevent any chance of him being a father.

His pull-out game wasn’t that great, and even though he had successfully gotten some women to abort their pregnancies for him, he wondered how long he could keep that up.

He was sitting at his desk at work with a computer in front of him, absent-minded and oblivious to what was happening around him, when an idea popped into his head. “Pregnant women!” he said out loud.,

His co-worker, sitting beside him, with a look of surprise, said to Flame, “Pregnant women?”

Realising what he had said out loud, he replied with a look of innocence, “Nothing, I just had a great idea.”

Here was Flame’s thought process: having sex with pregnant women who also wanted sex would mean he would not have to use contraceptives during sex and thus avoid being a father altogether. He had just cracked the puzzle!

He found an online platform where he could meet women who wanted to have sex with other men, mostly because their husbands would not, in order not to endanger their babies.

Thirteen months after Flame began put his idea into practice, one of the women he had slept with and was three weeks pregnant told him that she had given birth to his son. Flame, thinking it was a joke, laughed it off. He thought it was funny until the woman explained what had happened.

Pregnancy scans had shown that she had two foetuses in her womb.

The simple explanation was that the foetuses were a twin, right?

Well, after delivery, her husband wanted to be sure the kids were his, so a DNA test was conducted. Both kids were not his; only one was. The test was repeated, but the result was the same. The doctor decided the result didn’t make sense except…

The doctor then explained a phenomenon to them: “Normally, a pregnant woman’s ovaries temporarily stop releasing eggs. But in a rare phenomenon called superfetation, another egg is released, fertilises with sperm, and attaches to the uterine wall, resulting in two babies.”

Here is a quick summary: since one of the babies was not the husband's, it must belong to someone else…

The only other person the woman, had sex with during that period was Flame, which was why she came to him. A DNA test was performed, and it showed that Flame was the father.

The woman’s husband told Flame he would sue him when he came up with a reason.
And there we have it. Flame was going to become a dad and battle the husband of the mother of his child in court! He was in deep shit-trouble. It was not how he thought his plan would unravel.

Events such as a pregnant woman conceiving another child were rare, but they did happen, and Flame found himself on the very wrong end of this.

“Unlucky!” Slade said out loud. Several people in the vehicle stared at him for some time, but no one cared enough to ask him what he meant by that.

Slade was now thinking about the only girlfriend he ever had. He realised he had not bothered about the things Flame was concerned about. He was in the seventh month of the relationship with his girlfriend when they broke up.

He remembered he met her at a restaurant at his university. He was a new student at the time, and it was his third time at the restaurant. She was also a new student.

She was ahead of him in the queue and had gotten the food she wanted, but her debit card did not register on the POS machine, so she could not pay. Slade offered to pay, and she accepted. Slade got his food and was going to pick a corner of the restaurant to sit and eat when someone caught his attention. It was the girl he paid for her food. She signalled for Slade to come and sit with her.

They went on to have a good relationship, and it was one of the best things that happened to him at the university, but all good things, they say, must end. Slade wished that wasn't the case.

He was so devastated after the event that he wrote a poem during one of his despondent moments. He had never written any such thing before. The poem was this:

<div className="poem">
When you said, Friends come and go

You said We had a good time, but people grow

It melted my heart like heat does snow

Like the waves when they flow

My heart wondered to and fro

It’s hard for me to let you go

I just wanted you to know
</div>

He still didn’t understand how a person could stop loving someone they once loved, much more letting them go. Even after all that had happened, he never stopped loving her. He decided he would not get into any relationship for a long time. He had no idea how right he was and how long it would be.

He closed the novel, put it back into his bag, and zipped it up. He was hungry and was going to get something to eat.

<h1>CHAPTER V</h1>

<div className="quote">
- In rivers and bad government,
the lightest things swim at the top.
- ~Unknown
</div>

Looking out through a window of his vehicle, Slade could see people running after vehicles, trying to sell snacks, drinks, electronics… He could not think of any reason to get any electronic device; he needed food.

He remembered that as a kid, he used to be amused at the scene of sellers running as fast as they could to catch up with vehicles where their goods had been bought so they could get their money. The success rate was usually high since the event mainly occurred when vehicles could not move so fast because of heavy traffic.

The scene did not seem funny to him anymore. He realised these people were doing everything possible to make a living; that was their job! They didn’t have the luxury of sitting in offices with computers in front of them, earning at the end of the month. They had to stay under the sun, sometimes in the rain, if they would make any money.

Slade was going to graduate from his university very soon, and whenever he thought about the probability of getting a job when he was done, he always felt sad. Here was why: the unemployment rate in Nonce was about thirty-three percent. Let me describe to you how bad that was. There were over one hundred countries on Terra, and Nonce’s unemployment rate was the second highest in that continent. Slade didn’t know about this statistic but knew things were bad.

What did the government do about it? “Shit,” was the general answer of the citizens of Nonce. Depending on whom you asked, shit could mean the government did nothing or that all they did was useless.

Slade began to think that all the government did was to ensure that the country never got better and that people remained in poverty.

About two weeks prior, the government banned the sale of goods on highways. On the surface, it seemed like a good thing since people could get injured or some other bad event could occur. But the government had provided no other avenue for these people to make money; hence, the sellers disobeyed the order. Slade thought it was good they disobeyed; otherwise, he would not be able to get anything to assuage his present hunger.

Some time ago, the Leader of Nonce said the country’s youths were “lazy,” which was why they had no jobs. Slade could see many people selling all sorts of things, many of whom were about his age or a little older. Yet, the government wanted to take away their only means of livelihood without providing an alternative. The problem was definitely not with the youths, Slade thought.

He called the attention of a seller to buy what he wanted. The seller would not have to run after a vehicle this time since all vehicles on the highway were no longer moving. Reports got to them that there had been an accident somewhere before them and that it would take some time to clear the road.

Slade had been in a hurry to leave the house that morning and had skipped breakfast. He was eating now, and it felt good.

He wondered why Nonce was the way it was. He decided that good people in governance could improve things, but not according to his parents. His parents had told him that only bad people were in the government and that a good person who decided to join the government would become evil. He had heard a quote so much, with no idea who made it or when it was made:

<div className="poem">
“Power corrupts”
</div>

Slade had decided the quote made no sense. Surely, Slade thought, we are absolutely in charge of our actions, and nothing could make us do something we would not want to do.

Slade believed that if a gun were pointed at him so that he could carry out an action or die, whatever decision he made would entirely be up to him. He hated it whenever he heard people say, “I had no choice.” He disagreed with that.

He had read a book some time ago and agreed with the writer’s view on power:

<div className="poem">
All governments suffer a recurring problem:
Power attracts pathological personalities.
It is not that power corrupts but that it is
magnetic to the corruptible.
</div>

Slade thought this made more sense since his country was one of many places where evil people were in government. The difference was that in some countries, bad people were often held accountable when they did something against the law and the people’s interests. They were not untouchable. Slade did not think the same applied to Nonce. Those in the government did ridiculous things but were never held accountable. He was worried that things would only get worse if corruptible people kept getting into the government while those who really could help citizens of the country and impact change didn’t bother getting in because “power corrupts,” and they didn't want to become bad people.

In high school, Slade had been told that the form of government practised in their country was a democracy. Here is how democracy was described:

<div className="poem">
A government of the people, by the people, for the people
</div>

A government of the people refers to the government's composition. It refers to the fact that the government had to be made up of people who came from the people. A government by the people refers to who chose those people who made up the government. A government for the people refers to the fact that every policy and decision the government makes should be in the people’s best interest.

Slade was not eligible to vote during the previous election; he had always been home during such periods. The most dominant reports during such periods were about rigging. Videos of people stealing ballot boxes and paying people to vote for a particular person permeated the internet and could be seen on television. Slade could not understand why the government wouldn’t want to do everything possible to ensure the people’s votes were counted. He thought they played some game amongst themselves: may the best rigger win!

Slade thought it was evident that the government was not for the people. They usually made many promises like the provision of electricity, jobs, and good roads… but they seemed to develop dementia once they got into power. Slade thought it was incredible that Nonce had no consistent power supply, even though the politicians always claimed they would fix that if elected. He realised that those in power could not be bothered by that since they had all the money of taxpayers, all the money generated with the country’s resources in their hands, and could generate electricity in their homes through some other means.

Slade decided that only dumb people, or people with no regard for human lives, could behave the way the government of Nonce acted. Either way, he thought they were shallow beings with little emotional and intellectual depth and that people like them should not be allowed to govern a nation.

Slade made up his mind that he was going to go into government politics at some point in his life. “I could be an agent of change,” he said to himself.

Would Slade have turned around the fortunes of Nonce for good as a politician if he got the chance? You will never know, and neither did he.

He was done eating and decided he was tired of sitting down. Regardless of how that would make him feel, he would get out of the vehicle and walk around for some time.

<h1>CHAPTER VI</h1>

<div className="quote">
- Life contains but two tragedies.
One is not to get your heart’s desire;
the other is to get it.
- ~George Bernard Shaw
</div>

Slade began to think he would have been better off resting at home than the shit he found himself in at that moment.

Earlier that morning, he had tried to stay awake as he waited for power to be restored, so he could iron the clothes he would put on. Slade’s area had had no power supply for about two days, but that wasn’t a strange occurrence to him. It was pretty normal, and while two days of no power was bad enough, he had experienced much worse.

Slade supposed that if there was going to be power that day, it might as well be that morning. Here is where Slade differed from many people in Nonce: he held out hope, most times, that things would be better. He had a habit of seeing the future of his country through his humanity: He thought if few people could do some good-which he did from time to time-even when things were tough, others might just come to imbibe such acts of selflessness in time.

Nonce could supply power to its people every single day of the year. Nonce was exporting power supplies to some of its neighbouring countries while the power supply in its nation was abysmal. Slade was sometimes driven crazy by facts such as these. He asked questions a lot, and his favourite was "Why?" He never really got satisfactory answers regarding political actions in Nonce.

It was two twenty-seven in the morning, and Slade still hoped he would get to iron his clothes. He had no plans to put on wrinkled clothes out of the house that day; If someone could do just that and act like nothing was wrong, it would be Slade. But in the few days Slade had spent at home, having reflected on his two years living on campus, he decided that he would like to behave like other students in some respects; he wanted to dress neatly, go out more, and meet new people…

Slade sat up straight up at the edge of his bed. He felt like lying on the bed, but he didn’t trust himself enough not to sleep once he did that. Sleep, he thought, was his enemy at that time.

Slade suddenly became intrigued by how something so beneficial as sleep could be undesirable at a particular time or forever. He thought that broken relationships and how the individuals who were once lovers abhorred each other depending on how it ended were examples.

“In a relationship,” he remembered his mum saying, “time reveals a multitude of sins.”

”Time,” Slade said to himself. He remembered that he was about thirteen years old when his mum dug a hole in front of their house to plant the a mango seed. She let him put the seed in the hole while covering it how she saw fit. Over the next few days, Slade was happy to water the hole every morning, and evening-he did miss sometimes-while he waited impatiently for the seed to germinate. “It will take some time,” his mum would say whenever she saw him examine the hole, and she was right. For Slade, three weeks was a long time, but he remembered being very happy when he saw a leaf emerge from the hole.

He felt an impulse to go outside to see the tree, but he didn’t have to; it was a tree he could describe perfectly well to someone who had never seen it. The tree was now bigger than any human-even giants-he could ever imagine, and with an average lifespan of over one hundred years, it would outlive many humans alive at that time.

Slade quickly realised that the thought of ageing and dying wasn’t peculiar to him. It was something almost every human on the planet was obsessed about.

As a kid, he always dreamt about growing older. Grown-ups around him could do whatever they wanted: go out at night, drive, buy whatever they wanted, drink, smoke… with no one asking-most times-why they did what they did. As he grew older, he found that many of his suppositions were untrue, but it didn’t matter; he wanted that freedom. He couldn't even stay out of the house for two hours without his parents complaining. Growing up assures freedom, better than I have now; at the very least, he had always thought to himself. And even though he learned that life wasn’t as simple as that, he still wanted to control all his decisions even though he knew he would also have to bear their consequences.

But something baffled him when he began to read books, in addition to the thought process of older people around him: they wanted to become young once more! This time, he was able to find out why. The answer? They didn’t want to die. But it didn’t make sense to him, just like many answers Slade had come across in his nineteen years living career on the planet. He couldn't understand why people would want to continue to suffer and feel pain forever! Maybe I’m missing something; he thought, something that when I possess, I wouldn’t want to lose. He thought that could only be the reason behind people’s irrational fear of death. Or maybe they were just scared of “What happens next if I die?”

“More like when they die,” he said to himself, smiling.

Homo Sapiens had many theories about what would happen or not happen after death.

Slade thought that although uncertainty was something humans could live with every day, it made their daily lives enjoyable as there's always something to look forward to but agreed it might become a bit much to cope with when the thought of something as final-or not-as death was involved.

He also found it ironic that for a species known as “wise one”-the literal translation of Homo Sapiens-there was a whole lot they did not know and understand.

He moved to the only table in his room to get a battery-powered torch; he then reached for his bag on the bed, from which he brought out a pen and book on which he wrote:

<div className="poem">
In times uncertain did I entreat

How much time do I have left?

How well does my life compare to those who have slept?

Those who in time past crept and leapt

To save themselves from the hand they were dealt

Their fingers copper and lead often felt

To make from them a substance they could smelt

All their lives they did toil and sweat

Till at last they embraced that fearful rest

Oh that they could tell of that which they met

Maybe they couldn't for they found nought
</div>

Lead to gold, immortality, they were things Alchemists would have given anything to discover, and Slade wondered if they had prioritised one over the other. Which was more important to them, Slade thought, if they could have gotten only one of wealth or immortality?

Slade thought nothing could be more boring and life-sucking than repetition, which was the only thing he thought immortality had to offer.

He had read a line from a book which he seemed to agree with totally:
What has been will be again, what has been done will be done again; there is nothing new under the sun.

Life had never been better, Slade thought, and it had never been worse. Life was shit and will remain that way until life ceases to exist if that ever happens.

“The miserable lot of humans,” Slade said to himself. How do I accept this as truth but still think I can turn things around for people around me? Deluded?

Slade decided it was best to go to sleep so he would not wake up too late for his journey that morning. Looking at the poem again, he felt a little sad but did not know why. He closed the book and put it in his bag, together with his pen and his torch.

He climbed onto his bed, dusted his feet, and unfolded a piece of cloth beside his pillow, which he used to cover himself. His eyes were open as he laid his back on his bed and hoped for power to be restored before he slept.
It never came.

<h1>CHAPTER VII</h1>

<div className="quote">

for not all tears are an evil.

</div>

It was six-thirty in the evening, vehicles were still at a standstill, and Slade began to worry about how long it would take before he got to his destination. He wondered how far he would have gone if, four hours earlier, he had trekked instead. He laughed at the thought of that.

He wasn't even bothered about not making it to the event he wanted to go to. The event was minutes away from being over. He was only disturbed by the fact that it was getting dark.

He took another brief look at his clothes. He had done this several times and told himself that they weren't too rough each time he did it. He didn't believe it.

All hopes of straightening his clothes had been dashed since power had not been supplied to his house, which meant his resolution of always looking neat, and sound would have to begin on his second day in school.

Slade took his thoughts back in time to some hours earlier that day.

“…Come on, boy, it's getting late.”

Slade wasn’t a deep sleeper, but he had barely slept four hours and was so tired that he didn’t wake up when his alarm sounded.

“You’re going to be late!” he heard his dad say again.

“Okay, Dad, thanks,” he replied, his eyes barely open and pretending he was about to get up. He heard the sound of his dad’s receding footsteps and immediately sank back into his bed but didn't go back to sleep.

He thought of things he ought to take to school and items that were not needed, so he could carry as light a load as possible when he realised... “I had a dream!” Slade said to himself in amazement.

Not that Slade never dreamt, but he never remembered most of them, not even the slightest detail. That made him wonder if he did dream or if he just imagined that he did.

"I took alcohol and was going to follow a girl home," he said, smiling. "Way more interesting things in my dreams than in real life."

He was glad he remembered the dream even though he deemed dreams pointless. Unlike in the movies, Slade thought, dreams don’t tell what will happen in the future. An A to my brain for imagination, though, Slade smiled, she's beautiful, and I would give a lot for this one to come true…

At nine o’clock, Slade wondered if the power supplier would save his blushes. “Just one cloth,” Slade said to himself, “I’ll sort the rest out in school.”

Slade had his bath and dressed up, not before asking his brother, then his mum if the clothes were very rough. They both used the word “okay” to describe the state of the clothes, but Slade wasn’t convinced.

Slade left the house without eating that morning. It was a Saturday, and his parents and brother thoroughly cleaned the house, which Slade was exempted from since he had to prepare for school. His mum had begun preparing food, but Slade told her he could not wait for the food. He said goodbyes to his family, with his mum telling him to focus on his studies and avoid distractions.

“Call me when you get there,” was the last thing his mother said to him. Slade smiled, knowing that he wouldn't call her as usual.

He was right, but in a way he never thought about.

At eleven twenty-three that morning, Slade was at the garage where he boarded the vehicle he found himself in. It took about an hour and thirty minutes for the vehicle to be filled with passengers before their journey began.

Slade looked at the watch on his left arm, “six forty-five,” he said to himself but didn’t stop looking at it. He began to wonder where all the qualities for which he had coveted the watch when he saw it with his dad for the first time had gone.

With something himself and his brother termed “transference”, he had ensured that the watch had become his within days of his dad getting it. He wondered how many of his current possessions he had gotten that way from his dad. He didn’t delude himself by thinking he did all that without his dad's indulgence. One of his ways to show he loves us, Slade thought.

Towards the right end of the road, he saw a billboard displaying an ad paid for by a telecommunication company-the only thriving telecommunication company owned by a citizen of Nonce in the country.

It was a very popular company but mainly for the wrong reasons.

Asides from the fact that to purchase a data plan, they had to pay more-or get fewer data bundles for the same price as other telecommunication companies charged-than what was charged by other companies, the service they provided both for calling and browsing was terrible.

At the end of the ad, the slogan “Rule Your World” was displayed.

“Yeah,” Slade said, chuckling. “No shit!”

The fact that the company knew they had terrible service in many areas, but they’ve done shit about it for years, was something that pissed Slade off about big companies in his country. And once again, the problem could be traced right back to the government since they got what they wanted-bribes-from those companies, and in return, they did whatever it was they wanted.

“We’re so fucked!” He said with no hint of a smile on his face.

Again, Slade became conscious of his rough clothes. He decided to compare what he put on to what others put on to see if he was better off than they were. It turned out to be a bad decision.

Slade sat in the vehicle’s front seat with the driver, the only other person in front.

In Nonce, many drivers wore clothes that made it hard for people to tell at once if they were dirty or just stained, and most times, they were rough.

Slade would have found little solace in the fact that the driver had a worse appearance, but when he looked, he wondered how unlucky he was to have him as his driver.

He had seen the driver numerous times during the couple of hours they spent together in the vehicle, but when he took a closer look at his clothing, he was impressed. The driver wore a blue shirt and black trousers; both looked clean and ironed. He also had his hair combed! It wasn’t how Slade would have ever imagined a driver. 

“As a driver,” Slade remembered his dad telling him, “you have to consider yourself the only sane person on the road. Other drivers are mad!” That was his dad’s way of telling him to be extremely careful whenever he drove.

Slade wondered if the good looks of his driver translated into good driving. He had not seen any reckless driving from him to think otherwise.

Slade thought there should be an award for people in Nonce who drove almost daily and still made it to the end of the year. He also believed that if there were a book named “Multiple Ways to Die,” driving in Nonce would find its way there.

He thought that there was a lot wrong with driving in Nonce. Aside from the problem of bad roads, the police were not interested in upholding the law. This was slightly ironic because they were always found on the road. Slade could hardly remember when he travelled and did not find a cop on the road. What were they doing if they were not upholding the law? Slade knew the answer to that.

Drivers beat traffic lights and broke other traffic laws whenever they felt like it. Why? They knew they could get away with it.

How could this be pinned on the government? Easy! Cops in Nonce were underpaid. They received one of the poorest salaries on the continent!

Slade found his distinction between the government and the police funny since the police were a part of the government. But when he compared the standard of living of cops to that of most government officials, the relationship between them could be seen through that of a warrior and his shield. The shield protects the warrior from all sorts of missiles directed at him, but what does it get for all its troubles? Maybe a good polishing. The only difference here was that cops did not even get good polishing; they got peanuts for all their efforts-not that many of them actually put in much effort when it came to doing their jobs. And government officials? They were far from being warriors!

Chickens would be a better description, Slade thought.

Knowing this, it was easy for Slade, as it should be, for you to find out why cops were always on the road if they were not interested in upholding the law.

Drivers knew about the predicament of cops; they also understood “moneyshakes” would absolve them of all penalties they were supposed to face.

Slade knew his country had a long way to go if its present state would ever change for good. His parents used to tell him about how good things were when they were younger. He pictured it easily but didn’t see how it could be replicated or bettered.

Slade could hear the startup sounds of some vehicles before them. Almost all drivers had powered down their vehicles’ engines since there was no movement. Slade guessed that vehicles were beginning to move, and it would seem the driver also thought the same since he also powered up his vehicle. About thirty seconds later, Slade was in a moving vehicle, and his only hope was that the movement would not be impeded until he got to his destination.

After twenty minutes of continuous movement, it seemed to Slade that he might get what he wished.

Ahead, he saw an exit by the driver’s side of the highway. The highway was divided in two by vehicles that moved in the same direction as his and by those that looked to exit that side of the highway to the other side.

Vehicles that wanted out Slade’s side of the highway stuck to a lane beside the exit while other vehicles passed them by. Of course, some drivers decided they were in too much of a hurry to stay on that side of the road and wait their turn to exit. They took other lanes and were now trying to force their way through the exit before vehicles that got there before then. “Typical!” Slade said to himself.

Slade could clearly see the exit; it was clogged up due to the number of vehicles trying to exit simultaneously. Scenes like that were typical in Nonce, and he had seen a lot of them for him to be surprised. “Why do people do what they do?” He knew that wasn’t an easy question to answer.

Many people, including his dad, had told him it was nearly impossible to obey the country’s laws since she was in a terrible state. “That could only happen if the country improves,” Slade’s dad once said. Slade thought otherwise. He thought people doing the right thing always, even when they could be ridiculed for it, and when doing the wrong thing was not going to be punished, would go a long way in making the country better.

Slade looked away from the scene. He was at least glad then and had high hopes that he would reach his destination in about an hour.

He was wrong.

Slade saw smoke rise from the vehicle’s bonnet a few minutes later. The driver saw it, too, and manoeuvred the vehicle towards Slade’s end of the road to park.

Just when I thought it couldn’t get worse! Slade thought.

The driver ignored the questions of passengers who asked what the problem was as he moved out of the vehicle and towards the bonnet.

The driver returned to tell them some minutes later that the engine’s fan belt was bad, and that the vehicle would not be able to move further until it was repaired. He then told the passengers to leave the vehicle; he would hail other public transport vehicles and fix some passengers. This would only be possible if those vehicles had dropped off some of their passengers on the way.

“Fantastic!” Slade said to himself.

It was almost 7 O’clock, and it was dark. There were no functioning streetlights on the highway, and the only source of light came from the vehicles that drove by.

The passengers were about to exit the vehicle when five people in masks surrounded them. Slade and the driver were already outside the vehicle and were ordered to get back in it.

Robbers! Slade thought.

One of the robbers approached the driver, took all the money he had on him, and stayed with him. One opened the door to the passenger's seat, while another opened the door to Slade’s. The passengers, with guns pointed at them, were then told to pass along the bags, purses, and money they had with them and that no one would get hurt if they obeyed. They all seemed to do this as quickly as they could, except Slade, who stared at the robber before him as though he had not heard the instruction.

Slade thought it was a funny scene. He knew things could happen in Nonce, but this? In the middle of a highway? Surely people would intervene, but hopes of that happening dwindled quickly as the first few vehicles that passed them by seemed to increase their velocities as soon as they noticed the scene.

My laptop! My phone! Slade thought, basically, my life! I should be able to do something about this!

Slade had some delusions that led to that final thought process. Whenever he watched movies or read books, he felt he could do the things that were done in them, even without practice.

It was too bad for Slade because some things done in movies could not be replicated in reality.

Slade had never touched a gun in all his years on the planet. He had never fired one but thought that was the easy part. He thought the hard part was getting the gun from his assailant’s hands.

Slade turned a deaf ear to the voices of other passengers telling him to “Just do what they say.”

The robber before him told Slade he would get what he wanted, even if it meant pulling it off his dead body. Slade, calm and collected, was preparing to lunge at the robber in front of him when the robber, by the other passengers, shot his gun into the air. That seemed to bring clarity to Slade.

Slade had never heard a gunshot sound that close, and for the first time that evening, he was terrified. He reluctantly handed out his bag to the robber, who snatched it from his hands and dropped it into their sack. Four of the robbers made to leave and called out to the fifth, who was still looking at Slade. Slade imagined he was pissed at him.

He had no idea how much.

The fifth robber was walking away from the vehicle to join the other four when he stopped, turned around, and walked toward Slade. With his gun pointed at Slade, and an irate look, which Slade saw only because of the light that came from other vehicles passing by, he said, “You fucked with the wrong person.”

Slade had never seen a bullet, not even the one shot into the air earlier by one of the robbers, and he was never going to see one. As the robber pulled his trigger, Slade only saw a flash. He heard screams too.

<h1>EPILOGUE</h1>

It was 9:13 in the evening. A woman, a man, and a boy were dining silently at a table. The only sound that could be heard were those made from the clashing of aluminium cutleries on ceramic plates.

At that moment, the boy seemed focused on cutting a piece of meat on his plate with the cutleries in his hands. The man-with food still left on his plate-watched the boy in amusement as he struggled to cut the piece of meat with the tools in his hands.

The woman, not oblivious to the scene in front of her, seemed to pay more attention to the phone beside her plate as she ate.

"And what good value will using these useless cutleries instil in me!" The boy protested.,

"Table manners," the woman said, and that seemed to stop further protestations from the boy as he returned to cutting with a grumpy look. The man also returned to his food with a smile on his face.

The silence continued for about five minutes and was broken by the boy when he was done eating. "I can't believe I became more intelligent by using a fork and a knife, and I just can't seem to thank you enough!"

"You'll be thanking her sometime in the future when you realise this is a useful skill, and that time, the appreciation would not be sarcastic," the man said.

"Can't wait," the boy said. He stood up, cleared the plates from the table, and moved them to the kitchen.

"I see you're still worried," the man said to the woman. "He does this every time. He'll be fine."

"I've been trying his number for hours now; it’s switched off," the woman said.
"His battery is probably dead. He'll call you when-”

The phone on the table rang just then, and a look of relief on the woman's face was all the man needed to know who it was on the other side of the call.

"I told you to call when you get to school; what took you so long?" The woman said as soon as she picked up the call before the person on the other side could say anything.

"Yes, it is; who am I speaking with?" The woman said.

"The man lifted his head from his phone, surprised by the turn of the conversation."

"Who's that?" The man asked.

The woman did not reply. The boy stood transfixed at the kitchen door he had just exited, looking intently at the woman just as the man was.

"No, no, no," she said.

"It cannot be!" She cried out as tears began to form in her eyes.

The man sprung to his feet as he collected the phone from the woman's hand.

"Who's speaking?" The man said with all the strength he could muster.

"That's right," the man said to the person on the other side of the call.

In about thirty seconds, the man wore a look of helplessness.

"Text me the address," the man spoke into the phone with a much weaker voice than when he took it from the woman. He sank into the chair and dropped the phone on the dining table.

With the current mood in the room, the boy could quickly tell what sort of news his parents had received. He hoped it wasn't what he thought it was. 

He went around the dining table and looked at the caller’s identity on the phone his father had just dropped.

My brother’s number, he thought to himself, but he was not the one at the other end of the call...
