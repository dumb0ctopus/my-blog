We're all going to die

We'll someday take the last blink of our eyes

Bring it my way

She cried in dismay

I've toiled all for nought

And I'll leave on my terms

But you don't have a say

Oh you don't have a say

A rope round your neck

Then you can catch a break

But it won't be your choice

No, it won't be your choice

With a smile on her face

Like she knew I was wrong

Some pills on the table

Some pills on the floor

And a nude body lying

Like the day she was born

But it wasn't her choice

No, it wasn't her choice

But the angel that whispered

The angel of death
