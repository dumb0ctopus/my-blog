I barely dream

But last night I saw Einstein riding a light beam

I was riding one as well

And I saw your past, your present and future

But I wasn't in it

I was up there watching

I was up there willing

But there was no miracle

There was no magic I knew

To make it happen

I tried to reach out

But I couldn't

My limbs just wouldn't move

I tried to call your name

But my lips wouldn't part

And even if they could

I would be wasting my time

I saw it already

And I wasn't there

But better the dream

Because I saw you yesterday

And many days before that

With wrong with my limbs

And my lips perfectly fine

They still didn't part

Only my eyeballs moved

As I watched you walk out the door
